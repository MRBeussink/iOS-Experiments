# iOS-Experiments
This is my attempt to start experimenting with iOS dev by building small apps and projects around a question instead of asking Google.

## Segue Test

**Q:** What happens when you use IB to segue to a view from two different views both are embedded in different navigation controllers.

**A:** Behavior is pretty much the same as if there was only one nav controller.

**Note:** IB will use the last linked nav bar as the one shown in the storyboard.
